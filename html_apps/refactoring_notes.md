# Refactoring Summary for Probabilistic ROC App

## Overview

- Migrated the visualization into a standalone, reusable module (`window.AUCVisualization.create`) that returns an instance API suitable for htmlwidgets.
- Scoped all DOM interactions to a supplied root element, enabling multiple instances per page and easy embedding in R markdown documents.
- Injected component-specific CSS dynamically (and only once) so htmlwidgets can manage styles without editing the host page.
- Replaced static global state with per-instance fields inside the `AUCVisualization` class; state resets cleanly between dataset loads.
- Exposed configuration knobs (`setConfig`, `setPalette`, `setStrings`, `setDatasets`) with live re-rendering to support runtime customization from R.
- Built a formal event system (`datasetLoad`, `aucChange`, `sample`, `autoArrange`, `dragComplete`) to let htmlwidgets forward events back to R.

## Key Steps

### 1. Modular Entry Point
- Wrapped all logic in an IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression—a function that runs as soon as it is defined) and exported `AUCVisualization.create`.
- Added `destroy`, `rebuild`, `on`, `off`, and accessor helpers so R wrappers can manage lifecycle.
- Preserved auto-initialization (`window.aucVisualization`) for the standalone HTML version.

### 2. Shared Palette & Config Objects
- Centralized colors in `DEFAULT_PALETTE`; legend now references palette keys.
- Added `DEFAULT_CONFIG` for radii, margins, grid sizing, overlay height, etc.
- Introduced `setPalette` and `setConfig` APIs that rebuild using the active dataset.

### 3. Dataset Normalization
- Created `normalizeDataset()`/`normalizeDatasetMap()` to validate inputs and coerce scores/labels.
- Saved metadata with each dataset and surfaced it in events & snapshots.
- Added `setDatasets`, `loadDataset`, and `loadDatasetByName` convenience methods.

### 4. Event Hooks
- Implemented listener registry and exposed `on/off` methods.
- Fired events for dataset loads, AUC updates (calc & sampled), random sampling, auto-arrange, and drag completions.
- Bundled sample statistics and dataset snapshots with every event payload.

### 5. State Encapsulation & Dependency Isolation
- Converted globals (nodes, anchors, counters, drag state) into instance fields.
- Replaced `document.getElementById` with `root.querySelector('[data-role=…]')`.
- Namespaced markup with `data-role` attributes to avoid conflicts.

### 6. Stylesheet Separation
- Removed inline `<style>`; injected scoped CSS via `injectStyles()` the first time a widget is created.
- Used `.aucviz-root …` selectors so styling is contained to each widget instance.

### 7. Internationalization Bundle
- Moved strings into `DEFAULT_STRINGS` and added `setStrings()` to override labels and legend text.
- Exposed defaults via `AUCVisualization.defaults.strings` for htmlwidget authors.

## Ready for htmlwidget Integration

- The widget can now be instantiated inside R with `htmlwidgets::onRender` by calling `AUCVisualization.create(el)`.
- Hooks provide a clean path to send events back to the R session.
- Configuration functions accept lists from R for palette, layout, and copy adjustments.
- Styles inject automatically, avoiding manual asset management in the widget binding.

These refactors collectively make the app modular, customizable, and easy to embed inside an htmlwidget package.

## Non-Technical Summary

- The app is now packaged so it can be dropped into other pages (or R notebooks) without conflicts—everything it needs stays inside its own container.
- All of the colors, labels, and layout settings live in one place, making it easy for teachers to tweak the visuals without digging through code.
- The code keeps track of its own state, so refreshing the data or loading multiple copies works reliably.
- New “signals” fire when datasets load, auto-arrange runs, samples are drawn, or drags finish, so the R side can react or record what happened.
- Styling moves with the widget: When you embed it, the look comes along automatically, but only affects the widget itself.
